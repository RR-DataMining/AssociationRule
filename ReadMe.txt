Goal:
Main goal of the project is to gather dataset from twitter and implement apriori algorithm.
Here, NSE is used as the key account based on which hasghtags related to it are gathered and analyzed based on which .

Sections:
There are 2 sections - Dataset using Twitter API and Implementation of Apriori Algorithm

Packages:
Tweepy - Implemented
Pandas - On process
MatplotLib - Have to implement

Process:

-->  Gather Twitter API using Twitter developer application
-->  Using Twitter API and Tweepy library, gather the required details from a twitter account (Eg: NSE)
-->  Gather the list of keywords 
-->  Analyze them and derive the association rule using Apriori algorithm
-->  Determine the frequent sets
-->  DÄ“rive the prediction of keywords when a keyword is used based on the historic values.



Notes:
Issues faced:
--> We used Apyori package at first
--> Twitter Developer Rights 
--> Rate limtation of Twitter API usage
--> Issue in output -- Have to rectify
--> Visualization issue
